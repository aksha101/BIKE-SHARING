# BIKE-SHARING

#Problem Statement:

A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

#Business Objective:

The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demandsvary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's epectations. Further, the model will be good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

#The above desired model is made by doing Data understanding, Data Preparation, EDA, Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets, and by Builing a Linear Model.

#Conclusions:
1)The error terms are normally distributed.
2)The training and testing accuracy are nearly equal hence there is no Overfit/Underfit situation. 
3)The predicted values have linear relationship with the actual values.

*Below are the top 3 features contributing towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes -
> Temp
> Spring
> Saturday
